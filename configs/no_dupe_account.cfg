		// This config part uses GeoIP, bundled with SourceMod by default.
		// To update GeoIP and have correct results, you can update SourceMod every month.
		// Watch out: IP localization can be imprecise. I would not advise banning people.
		// If your server only allows a specific language, it might be a good idea to block other countries.
		// It's also a good idea to block countries that are only used by people with VPNs to circumvent bans.
		// 
		// False-positive? You can whitelist some players/IPs using the 'Players' config part at the top of the file! Method name: 'country'.
		// 
		// Format:
		// "Country 2 letter code" (can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)
		// {
		// 		"time"	"0" // -1 = kick  |  any positive integer = ban this amount of minutes  |  0 = ban permanently
		// 		"reason"	"This country is blacklisted!" // the reason that will be used. Will be displayed to the user!
		//
		// 		"command"	"sm_ban {userid} {time} {reason}" // OPTIONAL! Allows you to use different commands, this way we support pretty much any banning/kicking system.
		//		// supported variables (optional, you can manually write your command yourself):
		//		// {userid} = client userid with # before (ex: #103)
		//		// {steamid} = client SteamID2, starting with STEAM_1 (ex: "STEAM_1:1:57298004")
		//		// {time} = what you entered in 'time'.
		//		// {reason} = what you entered in 'reason'. Avoids any problem with the double quotes character. (Ex: "This country is blacklisted!")
		//		// If double quotes aren't supported (like for the default sm_ban command, enter "command" yourself.)
		//		
		//		// So "command"	"sm_ban {userid} 1440 This country is blacklisted!" will also work! (in case your plugin allows reasons that aren't entered within double quotes)
		//		// -> "command"	"sm_ban {steamid} {time} {reason}" will send: sm_ban "STEAM_1:1:57298004" 0 "This country is blacklisted!"
		//		
		//		// "command" is also supported for kicking, although not recommended, and works the exact same way, except {time} variable doesn't work.
		//		// Not specifying any command with "time" "-1" will use the built-in kicking method which allows longer reasons and doesn't trigger double quote bug.
		//		// Specifying "time" isn't required.
		// }
		// 
		// If no country is found for an IP, the country code will be "XX".
		// 
		// Examples:
		// "FR" // block French people
		// {
		// 		"time"	"1440" // ban them for a day
		// 		"reason"	"French people are not allowed on this server"
		// }
		// "US" // block United States people
		// {
		// 		"time"	"-1" // kick them
		//		"reason"	"United States people are not allowed on this server"
		// }
		// "DE" // block German people
		// {
		// 		"time"	"30" // ban them for 30 mins
		// 		"reason"	"Sorry, but your country is not allowed on this server"
		//		"command"	"sm_tempban {time} {steamid} {reason}" // invented command for the example
		// }
		// "XX" // block IPs that have no country assigned to it (outdated GeoIP table, but is common for VPNs)
		// {
		//		"time"	"-1" // kick them
		//		"reason"	"Unable to verify your country. Please make sure you dont use a VPN, else, contact the admins"
		// }
		
		// If whitelist is enabled: time, reason and command will have to be entered on this level, not inside a contry 2 letter code.
		"whitelist"	"0" // If set to 1, this becomes a whitelist instead of a blacklist (meaning only the countries that are specified here can connect).
