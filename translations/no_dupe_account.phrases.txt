	// Players should also be free to play with VPNs, but we know that they are most of the time used for illegal stuff
	// I do not recommend kicking for this or setting this as a check, since most of the people will NOT use a VPN and get on the server, and those who use them aren't always bad people!
	// Just set it to 0 or 1 and you should be fine.
